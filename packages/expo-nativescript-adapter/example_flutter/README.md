# test_suite_flutter

A Test Suite for Expo Modules on NativeScript.

## Getting Started

- Grab the universal modules themselves (currently distributed as NPM packages) by running `yarn` in this directory.

- Assuming NativeScript is already installed, use your IDE of choice to run the app or use `tns run` at the command-line with a device (optionally) attached to build, install, and launch the app on your device.

**Note:** if you see an error on the iOS side about CocoaPods complaining about a pre-release version of the unimodule it's trying to link, run `pod update` in the `example/ios` folder. That should resolve your issue.
